With the help of my research mentors and many amazing people of the internet, I was able to fumble my way forward and learn a number of techniques to analyze and visualize data in R. I have since been building on my R and data science skills, including with the help of two key courses at CSU: “Quantitative Reasoning for Ecosystem Science” (ESS 330) and “Introduction to Environmental Data Science” (SOCR 580A7). Since I can’t yet publish data from my research projects, this portfolio is constructed of public data examples, primarily from my coursework in those two courses. Its purpose is a) to serve as a reference for myself and others learning to use R for environmental analyses, and b) to demonstrate my current R knowledge to advisors and colleagues.
